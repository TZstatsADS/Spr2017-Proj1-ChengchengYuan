### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. The project is to build a R Notebook Data Story on US presidents' inaugural speeches.

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: Comparison and Commonality Wordcloud Based on the Clustering Results of Topic Modeling
+ This project is conducted by Chengcheng Yuan

+ Project summary: In this project, I produce two comparision wordclouds and one commonality wordcloud based on the clustering result of topic modeling which classifies the speeches of presidents into five clusters. In two comparision wordclouds, I set the maximum word to 200 and 2000 respectively and from the results we can inspect the difference of important words in each cluster. In addition, I also calculate the word frequency of speeches in each cluster and plot a graph to show the exact frequency of some important words and make some comparision based on the graph.
